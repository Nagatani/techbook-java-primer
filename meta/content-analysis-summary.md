2. **Week 2**: Java Basics (11 files)
3. **Week 3**: Classes and Objects (6 remaining files)
4. **Weeks 4-13**: Advanced topics (47 files)

### Phase 2: Content Mapping and Gap Analysis
1. Map all source content to current book chapters
2. Identify specific content gaps
3. Assess integration complexity
4. Prioritize integration opportunities

### Phase 3: Integration Planning
1. Create specific integration recommendations
2. Develop content adaptation strategies
3. Plan exercise and example integration
4. Establish implementation timeline

## Systematic Approach Recommendation

### Option A: Chronological Processing (Recommended)
**Benefits**:
- Follows logical learning progression
- Identifies concept dependencies
- Maintains pedagogical coherence
- Easier to track coverage gaps

**Process**:
1. Analyze files in order (00-01 through 13-02)
2. Extract key concepts and learning objectives
3. Identify integration opportunities
4. Document dependencies and progression
5. Create integration recommendations

### Option B: Topical Grouping (Alternative)
**Benefits**:
- Focuses on specific subject areas
- Easier to compare similar content
- More efficient for specific improvements

**Process**:
1. Group files by topic (Setup, Basics, OOP, GUI, etc.)
2. Analyze each topic cluster
3. Compare with current book chapters
4. Identify best integration opportunities

## Implementation Strategy

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Complete Week 1 Analysis**: Finish analyzing remaining 4 files
2. **Document Integration Opportunities**: Create specific recommendations
3. **Assess Current Chapter Coverage**: Compare source depth with current content

### Short-term Goals (Weeks 2-3)
1. **Complete Weeks 2-3 Analysis**: Cover Java basics and OOP fundamentals
2. **Create Integration Plans**: Develop specific content integration strategies
3. **Begin High-Priority Integrations**: Start with most valuable content

### Long-term Goals (Month 1)
1. **Complete Full Analysis**: Analyze all 67 source files
2. **Comprehensive Integration Plan**: Create complete integration roadmap
3. **Implementation Prioritization**: Rank all integration opportunities

## Success Metrics

### Analysis Completeness
- Source files analyzed: Target 67/67 (100%)
- Book chapters mapped: Target 23/23 (100%)
- Integration opportunities identified: Target 50+ opportunities

### Integration Quality
- High-priority integrations: Target 10+ opportunities
